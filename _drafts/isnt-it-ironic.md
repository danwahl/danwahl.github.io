If you donate blood regularly, your ferritin levels are probably very low. Is this a problem? Is this _the_ problem? What, if anything, should be done about it?

# Why is iron important?

<!-- Some stuff about what iron does in the body -->

Iron plays a large role in several essential bodily processes, most notably in the transport of oxygen throughout the body via hemoglobin in red blood cells. It also has implications in other critical systems such as:

- Cognitive development
- Immune system function
- Regulation of body temperature
- Muscle metabolism and physical performance

The typical human has about ~3500 mg of iron, mostly

## What's a ferritin?

<!-- A bit about ferritin itself and its purpose -->

# What happens to iron levels when you donate blood?

<!-- A bit about how much iron is removed via whole (or double red) -->

## How long does it take to recover?

<!-- How this affects various quantities over the next several hours/days/weeks/months -->

# What's the evidence for the negative health effects of low ferritin?

<!-- Articles and studies related to low ferritin levels -->

<!-- Anecdata including the Iron Protocol -->

# Why should we be cautious about these findings?

<!-- Tweet re: health claims around coffee/caffeine/wine -->

<!-- General sense that we're prone to seek simple explanations re: health (lead, obesity, chronic lyme, long covid) -->

<!-- Survey data showing nonsignificant results around ferritin levels -->

# What, if anything, should be done about it?

<!-- Blood tests related to iron levels and what to look for -->

<!-- Iron supplementation and the various options -->

<!-- Iron infusions and the various options -->

# Conclusion

<!-- Even if this is nothing, or even if it's 5%, supplementation is cheap and unlikely to be harmful -->

<!-- Be careful when donating blood, especially double red. Consider taking much longer breaks between donations. --/>

<!-- Get your ferritin tested at your next checkup (and share the results with me, if you feel comfortable)! -->
