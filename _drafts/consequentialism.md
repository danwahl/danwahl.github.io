title: The Banality of Consequentialism
excerpt: or What What I Talk About When I Talk About Moral Philosophy
---

Starting in the spring of 2020, I embarked on an ambitious, self-guided journey through the history of moral philosophy. At the beginning of the process, I had high hopes of turning it into a series of book reviews that I'd post on this blog, but it turned out that simply _reading_ the selected books was enough of a slog, thank you, and until now I haven't found the energy to convert my notes into even _one_ published post.

But now, more than a year after I finished, some subprocess in my brain has finally condensed the information into a useful (for me, at least) form, and so I'm going to try to get the key ideas down before I forget why they seemed interesting in the first place (and thus become incapable of properly explaining them).

For the record, I started and ended a Utilitarian, a fact that can probably be derived from my Goodreads ratings of the ten books on my list:



Still, I did learn which bullets need biting, and more importantly, come up with a novel (to me), if dubiously accurate, taxonomy of moral philosophies that helped deconfuse things along the way (despite valiant attemps by some of the authors).

Mostly, my takeaway is that Consequentialism isn't wrong, but also it _isn't even_ wrong, and I'm not sure it _could_ be wrong. As such, it both dissolves and simulatenously endorses other moral philosophies (though on its own terms). Its proclomations are so simple as to be incomprehesnible, and smart people consistently miss the point entirely. The point itself is entirely banal.

The proximal cause of this post was a Slack conversation I had with my friend about a recent joint Conversations with Tyler/Econlab podcast with Tyler Cowen and Russ Roberts. As part of their chat, they briefly touched on the topic of "utilitarianism" in economics (they are/were both econ professors). Some choice quotes:

> Roberts: "I think our profession has been so damaged by the Benthamite calculus"

> Cowen: "Utilitarianism is parasitic on nonutilitarian moral theories about which pleasures and pains we count, and for how much"

I'm going to quote parts of (my half of) this Slack conversation as a springboard for the remainder of the post. Here's my initial response to the above:

> Dan: I listened to a bit of this interview, but don't think I finished. I've never been much of a Roberts fan, at least compared to the rest of the George Mason diaspora.
> I sort of think the opposite of Cowen's statement is more accurate? As in, practical deontology and virtue ethics are parasitic on utilitarianism (or at least consequentialism) for which rules to follow and virtues to promote (i.e. what else makes specific rules and virtues good?). Though I wouldn't actually use the term "parasitic" if I wasn't responding to Cowen.

A good first here step might be to clarify terms. In my own words, without looking anything up, here's a colloquial definition for each of the key terms used above:

- **Virtue Ethics:** Humans are inherently biased in favor our own selfish interests. As such, we can't necessarily trust that our intuitions will promote the greater good, which is the realm of moral philosophy. And so we must work to hone our intuitions into their most virtuous versions. Do this because it is the _right thing_ to do.
- **Deontology:** Humans are inherently biased in favor our own selfish interests. As such, we can't necessarily trust that our intuitions will promote the greater good, which is the realm of moral philosophy. And so we must work to ignore our intuitions, and instead conscientiously follow the set of rules that, on reflection, everyone would endorse. Do this because it is the _right thing_ to do.
- **Consequentialism:** What actually matters is not what we _do_ (or don't do), but instead what _happens_ as a result. As such, there likely isn't one specific strategy we can follow to promote the greater good, which is the realm of moral philosophy. And so we must figure what the "greater good" actually means. Do _whatever_ produces the _best_ consequeces on these terms.
- **Utilitarianism:** What actually matters is not what we _do_ (or don't do), but instead what _happens_ as a result. As such, there likely isn't one specific strategy we can follow to  promote the greater good, which is the realm of moral philosphy. We define the "greater good" in terms of the positive (happiness) and negative (suffering) experiences of sentient beings, and call this utility. Do _whatever_ maximizes utility.

Back to Slack:

> I do think that, in other ways, utilitarianism does explicitly promote deontology/virtue ethics, in the sense that following them instead of "na√Øve utilitarianism" sometimes produces better consequences on its own terms. But I don't think that's the same as what Cowen is claiming (i.e. that the "better consequences" themselves are necessarily informed by things like deontology/virtue ethics).

This should make some sense if you subscribe to the above definitions. While Utilitarianism (unlike Consequentialism more generally) _does_ have a specific optimization parameter in mind, it is largely agnostic about which actions (or rules or virtues) will actually optimize it.

At this point my friend objected that, in his lexicon,
