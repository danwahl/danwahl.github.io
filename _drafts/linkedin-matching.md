In one of my favorite scenes from the movie Contact, billionarie S.R. Hadden (played by John Hurt) quips "First rule in government spending: why build one when you can build two for twice the price?"

The picture is mostly the same when it comes to charitable giving: to double your impact, give twice as much. But, occasionally,

In The Book of Why, Bayesian prophet Judea Pearl introduces a concept called the Ladder of Causation, which he uses to idenitfy three distinct levels of cognition based on the types of queries they are capable of answering. He posits the bottom rung, **Association**, is useful for answering questions like "what if I observe X?" while the middle, **Intervention**, adds in the possibility of action (e.g. "what if I _do_ X?").

The highest level is reserved for **Counterfactuals**, which can answer questions about hypothetical worlds of the form "what if I _had done_ X?". Pearl argues that this type of counterfactual thinking is what separates humans from animals, and also what separates true artifial general intelligence from the cutting-edge neural networks that, though they power our most advanced machine learning systems, are more akin to shallow pattern matchers than actual intelligence.

The notion of counterfactual thinking is central to the Effective Altrusim project, baked into both parts of the two-step recipe for Doing Good Better:

1. Using evidence and reason to find the most promising causes to work on.
2. Taking action, by using our time and money to do the most good we can.

In step 1, when searching for impactful interventions, we neeed to study the evidence with the relevant counterfactuals in mind. For example, LEEP's cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) _assumes_ that, had they not advocated for the elimination of lead in paint in Malawi, another organization likely would have within the next decade (and so LEEP only takes credit for "bringing forward" the regulation by several years).

Step 2 also requires a healthy dose of counterfactual thinking: LEEP's CEA also _deducts_ from their calculated effectiveness proportional to the amount of good their donors (and staff) would have done spending their time and money supporting other effective organizations.

# Other ways to give counterfactually

For the purposes of this post, I'll mostly be focusing on a "supply side" intervention for step 2. Because while it's important to focus on how best to _allocate_ our limited resources, we can also do more good by _increasing the amount_ of resources we give. And one of the best ways to do this is to find (true) counterfactual donation matching.

The Effective Altruism movement is already pretty good at finding and exploiting these programs, with yearly efforts to secure funds from Facebook's Giving Tuesday and Every.org's Fall Giving Challenge (by my estimation, EA-adjacent orgs accounted for at least $380K out of a possible $620K of Every.org matching funds, far surpassing Lil' BUB at a mere $20K).

But not all donation matching programs are counterfactually equal! While it's common for nonprofits to entice donors by offering 2x donation matching during the holiday giving season, it's not at all clear your impact is actually doubled. To know if a match is _truly_ counterfactual, we need to know where the matching money _would otherwise go_. Critically, the Facebook/Every.org money could have gone to _any_ nonprofit (or none at all!), which is a key consideration when evaluating matching programs.

# Corporate matching

One potentially underutilized source of donation matching is from corporate giving programs, which are sometimes provided to employees as part of their benefits package. When available, this type of matching does come with a few strings attached: most companies limit the size (~10K on average) and destination (from a list of approved charities) of the matching gift.

Still, this is arguably one of the best forms of counterfactual giving, since the money would otherwise be given to a different nonprofit, or more likely simply used for regular business activities. (It's worth noting that even "regular business activies" likely have positive expected value, given the worldwide rise in living standards since the industrial revolution.) If you're not sure whether your company offers this benefit, this is the first thing to check (either with your benefits documents, HR department, or [here]()).

## Getting more from others

 if you're self-employeed like me, or your company doesn't provide donation matching, you can still have a counterfactual impact by encouraging others to take advantage of theirs!
