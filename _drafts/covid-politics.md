title: The Future of American Politics, Part 1.5
excerpt: How COVID-19 might affect our elderly politicians.

When I started writing a series of posts called "The Future of American Politics," I picked the grandiose name as a tongue-in-cheek hat-tip to the inevitable futility of long-term political projections (especially ones based on such a simple model). But perhaps there are some non-obvious things that _can_ be said about political outcomes, with at least some statistical certainty.

Over the past several years I've become increasingly concerned about the fragility of our collective institutions, and the first several months of 2020 have done nothing to ease my mind. Viewed on this backdrop, COVID-19's evolution from a blip to an international crisis in three short months has been deeply unsettling, and the worst is likely yet to come.

The virus seems perfectly designed to exploit the respective weaknesses in our various political systems, from the bureaucracy in China that bungled the initial response, to the theocracy in Iran that refused to restrict religious demonstrations, to the kakistocracy in the US that seems determined to make the worst of an already bad situation. Various estimates show that, unless the rate of transmission is dramatically reduced, we'll run out of basic surgical supplies and hospital beds as soon as early April. Worse yet, there's good reason to suspect that the general public is _underestimating_ both the timing and scale of the impact, given that exponentials are notoriously counterintuitive.

Similarly, I think we're predisposed to underrate the importance of our current institutions, despite their obvious flaws. No doubt the world is awful and can be much better, but critically, it is also _getting much better_:

This is not true only of child mortality, but across nearly every important metric over the past two centuries, even as worldwide population has increased by 700%!

Typically, this only results in the conflicting demands to simultaneously preserve and improve our institutions, but the desperate need for preservation has become more emotionally salient for me over the past several weeks. Sure, we can and should protect our medical infrastructure by "flattening the curve" through a reduction in social and economic activity. But what about the parents whose kids are home from school? What about people who can't work from home, or whose businesses close due to lack of patronage? What about the billions of economic value lost in the form of pensions and 401(k) plans of impending retirees?

As in the Great Recession of 2008, these are questions that demand a strong response from the federal government. But unlike 2008, COVID-19 will likely be killing off some of very people in charge of that response.
