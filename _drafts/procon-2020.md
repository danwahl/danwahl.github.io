title: Literally Anyone Else 2020
excerpt: My official endorsement in the US Presidential race.
---

In an ideal world, the following post would be an endorsement of my favorite presidential candidate, Cory Booker. Like few other politicians (save maybe [Obama](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88061.Dreams_from_My_Father) [himself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9742.The_Audacity_of_Hope)), Booker seamlessly weaves an inspiring, Bernie-esque personal history of [lifelong activism](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/01/cory-booker-president-2020-profile-newark-projects-224539) with a pragmatic, Biden-esque knack for [bipartiasn coalition building](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/232538-booker-and-hatch-joke-about-parks-rec-cameo). His legislative accomplishments include victories in [criminal](https://www.booker.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=875) and [environmental justice](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s1689), and he has introduced several proposals especially close to my heart, including recent efforts to [improve air quality](https://patch.com/new-jersey/newarknj/cory-booker-sponsors-bill-improve-school-air-quality-areas-newark) and [shut down CAFOs](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/20/21028200/factory-farms-abuse-workers-animals-and-the-environment-cory-booker-has-a-plan-to-stop-them). He's also one of the few elected [vegans](/blog/against-thanksgiving), and has a [pretty cool girlfriend](https://www.newsweek.com/cory-booker-girlfriend-rosario-dawson-1458981), too.

But sadly, with Booker (and [everyone](https://www.yang2020.com/) [else](https://elizabethwarren.com/) [I](https://www.julianforthefuture.com/) [liked](https://michaelbennet.com/)) now out of the race, only two candidates remain viable in next week's Illinois primary: Biden and Sanders. I've done my best to remain agnostic between them up to this point, being especially wary of making any public commitments that might be difficult to rescind. But given that I need to vote for _somebody_ on Tuesday, now seems like as good a time as any to make a decision.

# ProCon 2020

Back in 2016 I built a tool for evaluating candidate preferences using ProCon.org's reference data, which works by measuring the user's preferences on a variety of political issues, weighted by relative importance. It then calculates a numerical correlation with positions of each candidate, ranging from 1 (perfect agreement) to -1 (perfect disagreement). After updating it with the latest 2020 data, answering the questions, and assigning weights, I got the following candidate correlations:

<iframe width="100%" height="600" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTrAJP9OLk8KNFHVLuw3I_ri6zHYodcPLsbTAONp3HDyxc36ZU_HmUPafaXKWWOonPo4C_nCLl6LUDp/pubhtml?gid=1645809904&amp;single=true&amp;widget=false&amp;headers=false"></iframe>

(You can calculate your own by making a copy [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17YKUKP0BvzHLZ3XBTBlY2rKOLHR1E7FpzRtpD8TOlwU/edit?usp=sharing), and filling out the "Answer" and "Weight" columns on the "form" sheet.)

Based on this chart alone, at least one thing is clear: I will *not* be voting for Trump. Otherwise, while my views are strongly correlated with both remaining Democrats, Sanders is a slightly better match. Still, looking at the full array of questions, we disagree on a few important issues.

For example, distasteful as it may be, [nuclear energy](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/answering-questions-about-nuclear-power/) and natural gas ([from fracking](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-09/fracking-is-the-bridge-to-a-fully-renewable-future) or otherwise) will likely play a critical role in our transition to zero-carbon electricity. Banning them ([probably](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/12/20857196/democratic-debate-climate-change-fracking-ban)) does more harm than good, because both nuclear and gas are [safer _and_ cleaner](https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy) than the ([mostly coal](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/natural-gas-use-is-rising-is-that-good-news-or-bad-news-for-the-climate/)) domestic energy sources they displace. It's disappointing that Sanders has [campaigned against both forms of energy](https://berniesanders.com/issues/green-new-deal/), even promising to [shut down existing, functional nuclear plants](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-10/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-nuclear-energy-plans-clash).

In contrast to these small but important disagreements, my objections to Biden's platform are more numerous but less substantial. Several of them, such as marijuana legality and UBI, strike me as [generational](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/) [politics](https://news.gallup.com/poll/228194/public-split-basic-income-workers-replaced-robots.aspx), with the eventual outcome already decided, while others, like [Medicare-for-all](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/8/18251707/medicare-for-all-bill-senate-filibuster-budget-reconciliation-byrd-rule) and the [decriminalization of illegal border crossings](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/743516166/npr-newshour-marist-poll-americans-not-sold-on-trump-or-democrats), seem politically intractable regardless of the next administration. This is hardly a ringing endorsement for Biden's milquetoast brand of center-leftism, but it's not much of an objection either.

See below for a full list of positions for each candidate, highlighted by agreement with my answers:

# Primary details

Given that my own politics are somewhere between Sanders and Biden, I would prefer that neither runs away with the nomination, in the vague hope that they can negotiate a best-of-both-worlds platform at the convention. And so, trying not to overthink things too much, I plan to cast my ballot in the way that most helps the eventual losing candidate. Thankfully, with fewer people in the race, the game theory implications of the state and congressional district [15% delegate thresholds](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-15-percent-threshold-for-primary-delegates-could-winnow-the-field/) are much simpler, and I can just vote according to [538's polling model](http://bit.ly/my-538-district) for my district:

[![my-538-district.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/my-538-district.png "my-538-district"){: .center-image }]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/my-538-district.png)

Biden and Sanders seem almost certain to split my district's delegates 4 to 3, so unless anything changes between now and Tuesday, I'll vote for Sanders.

# For Sanders Supporters

After [this week's results](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/10/us/elections/results-primary-elections-michigan-washington.html), however, it looks increasingly likely that Biden will capture the nomination. If (like most of my friends) you're a Sanders supporter, this might be a bitter pill to swallow, especially after his [strong performance through the Nevada caucuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/bernie-sanders-nevada-caucus.html). However, even though he might not personally win the Democratic primary, he has largely already won the battle of ideas within the party. Thanks in part to Sanders's presidential campaigns, policies like [Medicare-for-all](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/medicare-for-all-isnt-that-popular-even-among-democrats/) and a [$15 minimum wage](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/30/two-thirds-of-americans-favor-raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour/) are increasingly popular with mainstream Democratic voters; a dramatic shift of the Overton window in four short years. In fact, even the historically moderate Biden is running on a [mostly progressive platform](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/joe-biden-platform-progressive-health-care-climate-taxes.html), with a 0.7 unweighted correlation score with Sanders, compared with -0.8 for Trump.

Taking this idea [one step further](https://gist.github.com/danwahl/94ed99f0c3e0d7c62a16ede0c2d4ddef), I simulated 1000 virtual Sanders voters, generating random sets ProCon.org of answers and weights, and selecting only those who preferred Sanders with a score of at least 0.75. I then calculated their weighted correlation with both Biden and Trump, resulting in the following histogram of candidate preferences:

[![sanders.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/sanders.png "sanders"){: .center-image }]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/sanders.png)

Worth noting is that **none** of the 1000 simulated Sanders voters, each with a different set of preferences, would prefer Trump over Biden on the issues alone. While Biden may be an imperfect vessel for progressive policies, he's still the optimal second choice for the entire spectrum of Sanders supporters.

# For Biden Supporters

In the unlikely event that Biden is not the nominee, perhaps due to a health concerns or a dramatic collapse in the polls, his supporters should be prepared to make the same calculations as Sanders supporters are currently grappling with. To that end, I generated the weighted correlations for 1000 randomly generated Biden voters and graphed them below:

[![biden.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/biden.png "biden"){: .center-image }]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/biden.png)

Although it's slightly less stark, the results show that more than 99.5% of hypothetical Biden voters should prefer Sanders over Trump. Digging in a little deeper, I focused on one of the 0.5% in order to demonstrate a set of answers that a Biden voter would have to endorse in order to legitimately prefer Trump (only the highest weighted answers shown below):

| Question                                                                                         | Answer   | Weight   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Should the Federal Government Adopt Net Neutrality Rules?                                        | No       | Very     |
| Should Federal Taxes Be Increased?                                                               | Yes      | Very     |
| Should the US Implement a Wealth Tax?                                                            | No       | Very     |
| Should Election Day Be a National Holiday?                                                       | No       | Very     |
| Should Voters Be Required to Show Photo Identification in Order to Vote?                         | No       | Very     |
| Should Fracking Be Allowed?                                                                      | Yes      | Very     |
| Should the US Expand Its Use of Nuclear Power?                                                   | Yes      | Very     |
| Should the US Switch to a Medicare-for-All Healthcare System?                                    | No       | Very     |
| Should Immigrants Who Entered the US Illegally Be Denied a Path to Citizenship?                  | No       | Very     |

Is it possible to imagine a voter that is strongly in favor of fracking and nuclear energy, but equally opposed to Medicare-for-all and a wealth tax? Perhaps, but it's likely not typical of the median Biden supporter. While Sanders may be an imperfect vessel for milquetoast center-leftism, the only realistic alternative is significantly worse...

# For Trump Supporters

Obviously this post(/blog) is not aiming to persuade Trump supporters directly (well, [most of the time](/blog/kidney-donation)), but it's still worth considering what their preferences might be. The conventional wisdom that Biden, occupying the moderate lane, might appeal to disaffected Trump voters, seems to ring true, at least on the issues. While neither Sanders nor Biden have much conservative appeal, the following graph of 1000 randomly generated Trump voters matches my anecdotal impression that latter has slightly better odds of bridging the partisan gap:

[![trump.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/trump.png "trump"){: .center-image }]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/procon-2020/trump.png)

# For Unity

In the end, I'm not advocating for unity out of any particular sense of loyalty to the Democratic party. My own dream platform includes things like [animal liberation](/blog/against-thanksgiving), [open borders](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42867903), and [dramatically increased foreign aid](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dTdSnbBB2g65b2Fb9/eaf-s-ballot-initiative-doubled-zurich-s-development-aid) , all of which are well off the current political map. I would love to see a post-Trump recasting of the GOP as the party of [(neo)liberalism](https://neoliberalproject.org/), providing a robust, market-oriented alternative to the emerging socialist coalition on the left. I'm even a strong advocate for [voting reform](/blog/fairvote-sim), which could, among other things, help [dissolve our current party divisions altogether](https://www.electionscience.org/library/approval-voting-is-better-for-both-major-and-minor-parties/).

But I do think there's a simple, clear argument for (Democratic) unity in 2020, at least: the alternative is [so much worse](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-complete-listing-so-far-atrocities-1-546). Or, as Cory Booker more eloquently put it in [United](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25775926-united):

<blockquote>
  <p>The lines that divide us are nowhere near as strong as the ties that bind us; despite our very real differences, we share common interests, a common cause, and incontrovertibly, a common destiny.</p>
</blockquote>
