title: The Cooperative Manifesto
excerpt: A retrospective on four years of Creativity for the Common Good.
---

In late 2016 I was recovering from the shock of the presidential election, and bracing for the start of a new adminstration. A large fraction of my concern was for government agencies like the EPA and DOE, and the seemingly inevitable erosion of their core missions at the hands of incoming climate skeptics. A four (or eight!) year pause in the fight against rising CO2 (and sea) levels struck me as a tragedy of potentially apocalyptic proportions, and I wasn't alone.

Early the following year I joined forces with several other engineers, architects, and designers to form JustDesign, a cooperative with a mandate to provide affordable, professional services to mission-aligned companies, nonprofits, and community groups. Things went both better and worse than I expected.

Four years later the Trump administration is out, but so is JustDesign (the former thanks to the good sense of the American public, the latter due to irreconcilable differences). A full accounting of JustDesign's successes, failures, and lessons learned will have to wait for a later post. As a whole, though, I'm thankful for the experience, and expect great things from my erstwhile cooperators as we go our separate ways.

In this post, I want to share an unedited document that I produced for one of our final meetings, as we were reevaluating our mission and trying to chart a path forward. It both responds to some JD-specific concerns (without context, apologies), but also provides a broad sketch for a the type of organizational culture that I _think_ can succeed in ways that JustDesign, in the end, did not.

# What problem are we trying to solve?

The current global economic system, which has fostered an extended period of relative peace and prosperity, is also responsible for a wide range of negative externalities, tragedies of the commons, and rampant inequality.

Governments, which have a mandate to correct these problems, consistently fall short of their responsibilities. Nonprofits are well-intentioned, but lack clear feedback mechanisms, tending to perpetuate their own existence at the expense of their nominal mission. And individuals who are willing to help often find themselves unable, either due to financial constraints or simply lack of opportunity.

In short, what is best for the world is not always what is financially incentivized, and efforts to fill that gap have thus far come up short.

# What should JustDesign's mission be?

After the 2016 presidential election it became clear that, if the government (and specifically the EPA) could not be counted on to do its job, a new type of organization might be able to pick up some of the slack. That organization would need to sacrifice profit in favor of progress, while also attracting members with the wide range of skills necessary to solve our most pressing problems.

As such, JustDesign's mission should be twofold:

## Provide professional architecture, design, and engineering services at an affordable rate.

By providing the same high-quality services as other firms but at a discount rate, we have at least three tangible impacts:

1. We save our customers money that they would otherwise have been spent on more expensive services.
2. Relatedly, we allow projects to happen that would not have otherwise (either the current project, which may not have been affordable, or the next one which can be funded with the money saved).
3. We force other firms to reduce their prices in order to compete with us, saving their clients money and allowing more projects to happen overall.

### Why is it important that our clients pay us?

It's important that most of our clients pay us something for a few reasons. The first is that paying a "fair" rate for services (where fair is defined as what's affordable to the client) sends us a signal that the client values our work. This is not the only way that we know our work has value, but it is an important sign.

Second, we need to provide a reasonable wage for the architects, designers, and engineers that work for our clients. JustDesign members are value-driven, and are willing to work for less-than-market rates, but there is a bound below which we will be unable to attract the talent required to do the necessary work (due to financial constraints of potential members).

## Serve as a conduit for architects, designers, and engineers to gain access to clients that require their services.

Before co-founding JustDesign, I hadn't done much in the way of value-aligned engineering work, despite having an interest in using my education and experience for good.

Since co-founding JustDesign I've been a part of lead-rated filter distributions with PERRO, air-quality monitoring with ELPC (& partners), and solar power system design with Ilumexico, not to mention the rest of the good work that we've done as an organization.

An organization like JustDesign can signal both to potential clients and to potential workers, creating opportunities for the latter, many of whom may want to do value-aligned work but do not know where to begin.

### Do we all need to be value-aligned with each other?

Because of our voting system, where every member-owner has veto power over every organizational decision, it is in some ways not critical that others be precisely value-aligned. For instance, I'm a vegan, and while [I am persuaded that most others should be too](/blog/against-thanksgiving), I'm happy to work with omnivores if it furthers our mutual goals. Because I have veto power, I'm confident that I could prevent JustDesign from doing a project that would explicitly harm animals, even if other members were willing to approve it.

However, our veto system also presents a unique challenge. It's important that, if some members have hard constraints (i.e. veganism), others do not have the opposite constraints (i.e. are only willing to accept projects if they explicitly harm animals). Even just two members with mutually exclusive opinions could lead to dueling vetoes, and bring our work to a standstill.

I am not very concerned about this potential problem for a few reasons. First, most prospective members will likely not have mutually exclusive opinions, and we can selectively deny membership to those who do. (Note that we should not be afraid of admitting new members who don't have ideological commitments that are exclusive of others.)

Second, diversity of perspective is a vital ingredient for our work, because it allows us (and our clients) to benefit from the experiences of those with backgrounds different from our own. Among the reasons I value the other members in JustDesign is because they have a perspective that I don't always share, which helps me think about issues in ways that might not otherwise have occurred to me. We should seek out more of this, perhaps by directly appealing to new members with various identities and experiences, with the underlying goal of increasing diversity of perspective.

So while I do believe JustDesign should be "value-aligned" to some extent, I also think it's important that our membership be meaningfully ideologically diverse. In general, JustDesign members should be aligned in the sense that our common values allow us to build a broad and diverse team, with the shared goal of doing good work for our clients and the populations they serve.

# How will we know we're doing good work?

Because we're a "for-profit" company, we at least know the extent to which our clients value us, i.e. when they pay us what they can afford, or hire us again for follow-up projects. We should also be confident that, because we are seeking to build a broad and diverse team, we have only selected clients and projects that all of us individually believe will lead to good results in the world.

Still, there are times when the above will not be enough, and so we also should work to measure impact in a counterfactual manner (i.e. if we had not done this project, would the world have been better or worse, and by how much). Ideally, we can find tangible signs of impact, and maybe even cash them out in terms of [Quality Adjusted Life Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year) (QALYs), the gold standard for measuring the impact of medical interventions.

Assuming direct QALY measurements are infeasible, as they often are, we should look for indirect but tangible signs of progress. For instance, on the Ilumexico solar project, we might measure the number of Wh of solar energy that we are counterfactually responsible for generating, noting that had we not been hired, Ilumexico would likely have found an alternate engineering firm in the subsequent weeks. From there, we can infer that, had that same energy been generated via high-carbon alternatives such as diesel generators, it would have had a measurable social cost that was directly averted by our work.

## Which projects should we take?

Generally, we should accept all projects that are value-aligned (i.e. no members veto) and are profitable. Where projects are not profitable, and/or we have limited resources, we should select the ones that are: important (i.e. have a large impact on the world), tractable (i.e. we expect to make a significant contribution), and neglected (i.e. may not be done at all if not by JustDesign). (Note that I borrowed this from the [ITN framework](https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/).)

JustDesign should have the first right of refusal on all opportunities that are internally generated, but with the understanding that individual members are free to pursue the clients/projects that the organization as a whole declines.
