# Part One · Self-Defeating Theories

## Chapter 1 · Theories that are indirectly Self-Defeating

### 1. The Self-interest Theory

## Theory

A theory is an answer to the question “What do we have most reason to do?” It can be either moral or rational.

> What do we have most reason to do? Several theories answer this question.


## Moral

A description of right or wrong based on

## Rational

. For example:

> (S4) What it would be rational for anyone to do is what will bring him the greatest expected benefit.

## Self-defeating

> This argument, uniquely, needs no assumptions. It claims that a theory fails even in its own terms, and thus condemns itself.

## Self-interest Theory (S)

> This is a theory about rationality. S gives to each person this aim: the outcomes that would be best for himself, and that would make his life go, for him, as well as possible.

## Formal aims

The (tautological?) aim of a _category_ of theories (moral, rational), but not a _specific_ moral or rational theory.

> According to all moral theories, we ought to try to act morally. According to all theories about rationality, we ought to try to act rationally. Call these our formal aims.

## Substantive aims

> By ‘aim’, I shall mean ‘substantive aim’. This use of aim is broad. It can describe moral theories that are concerned, not with moral goals, but with rights, or duties. Suppose that, on some theory, five kinds of act are totally forbidden. This theory gives to each of us the aim that he never acts in these five ways.

## Hedonistic Theory

> On the Hedonistic Theory, what would be best for someone is what would give him most happiness.

## Desire-Fulfilment Theory

> On the Desire-Fulfilment Theory, what would be best for someone is what would best fulfil his desires throughout his life.

## Objective List Theory

> On the Objective List Theory, certain things are good or bad for us, even if we would not want to have the good things or avoid the bad things.

## Ultimate aims

The fundamental substantive aim of a given theory. For example:

> (S1) For each person, there is one supremely rational ultimate aim: that his life go, for him, as well as possible.

## Instrumental aims

> Other aims are instrumental, mere means to the achievement of some ultimate aim. Thus, for all except misers, being rich is not an ultimate aim.

## Central claim

The definition of the ultimate aim of a given theory.

### 2. How S Can Be Indirectly Self-defeating

## Indirectly individually self-defeating

> If we call some theory T, call the aims that it gives us our T-given aims. Call T indirectly individually self-defeating when it is true that, if someone tries to achieve his T-given aims, these aims will be, on the whole, worse achieved.

## Disposition

A broad set of a person's qualities and motivations, as opposed to a narrower view of their actions. This is somewhat convoluted because actions are often caused by qualities/motivations, but we are also sometimes obligated to act in a way that changes our disposition, if possible. Theories that tell us to have certain dispositions (for their own sake) are most closely related to virtue ethics, though both deontological (and consequential) eithical frameworks also sometimes call for dispositional change. For example:

> (S5) The supremely rational desire is that one’s life go as well as possible for oneself.

## Never self denying

In the case where there are multiple reasons for doing something, self-interest theory does not require us to be perfectly selfish, but only to never deny ourselves what would be best for us. We might act on other motivations so long as they are also in our best interests.

> In describing what it would be for me to be self-interested, it is enough to claim that, while I often act on other desires, I never do what I believe will be worse for me.

Parfit's claim is that it can, in some sense, be worse for us if we are never self denying (which is counterintuitive because we'd naively assume that it's at least always best for _us_ to act in our own interests). He gives the example of Kate, a writer who finds her work so rewarding that she often overtaxes herself to the point of exhaustion and depression. By doing so, she denies herself happiness (in an apparent violation of self-interest theory). However, in order to change her behavior, she would have to also change her desire to write good books, which make her worse off professionally. This demonstrates that Kate must deny herself something (either happiness or a rewarding career), and therefore can't be never self denying.

A clearer example is [Parfit's hitchhiker](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Parfit%27s_hitchhiker).

If S require us to be never self denying, and that leads to worse outcomes, then S is at least indirectly, individually self-defeating.

## Transparent

> Suppose next that I am transparent, unable to deceive others. I cannot lie convincingly. Either a blush, or my tone of voice, always gives me away.

### 3. Does S Tell Us To Be Never Self-denying?

## Expected benefit

In _uncertain_ cases, we have no beliefs about the probabilities of various outcomes, but in _risky_ cases we do, and should decide based on the

> To calculate the expected benefit from some act, we add together the possible benefits, and subtract the possible costs, with each benefit or cost multiplied by the chance that the act will produce it. Thus, if some act has a chance of nine in ten of bringing me some benefit B, and a chance of one in ten of causing me to lose some benefit that would be twice as great as B, the expected benefit is B × 9/10—2B × 1/10, or seven-tenths of B.
