title: Taking yourself hostage
excerpt: And other, more useful heuristics.
---

In 2016, the North Carolina state legislature passed the [Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Facilities_Privacy_%26_Security_Act), a law which, among other things, restricted the use of single-gender public restrooms to people with matching sex on their birth certificate. The political right, citing religious objections and a preference for states rights, generally supported the bill, while the left (correctly, in my opinion) saw it as an unnecessary provocation, and an affront to civil liberties.

But beyond the culture war, I think there is something uniquely instructive about this three-year-old controversy. Even at the time, while I was confident I was on the right side of history, I still struggled to find a secure argumentative foothold. And on a fundamental level, this seems reasonable; why prioritize the civil rights of transgender individuals, who feel uncomfortable sharing a restroom with the opposite (from their perspective) gender, over cisgender individuals who *have the exact same subjective preference*?

In the intervening years, mostly through increased exposure to various rationalist communities, I've been inculcated with a new set of concepts and ideas which serve as helpful guides when confronted with questions like the one above. Though not directly related, these are cousins to the heuristics that Kahneman discusses in Thinking, Fast and Slow, and for lack of a better word I'll use the same term to describe them here.

In this post I'll categorize and summarize some of the most useful heuristics I've encountered, and introduce one of my own (Taking Yourself Hostage), while using various aspects of the transgender bathroom debate where applicable.

# Moral philosophy

Before going too far in any direction, we should have a good idea where we'd like to end up. Different institutions, like religions and political parties, offer a readymade portfolio of opinions on topics like the transgender bathroom controversy, making for easy moral navigation. But taking one step back, it's unclear by which criteria we should choose between them. Religions generally presuppose the (mutually exclusive) divinity of *their* holy text, all but guaranteeing that the majority err, while political parties offer, at best, a coarse approximation of arbitrary moral consistency, especially in two-party systems like the US.

On its surface, however, a naive decentralized approach is hardly more appealing, since it replaces this single choice with the whole portfolio of questions, and offers no guidance for how to begin to answer. While this might be the preferred option for immortal philosopher kings, with eternity to map the whole moral territory, it's not much help to us finite subjects.

So if we reject institutions due to meta-uncertainty, but don't have time to figure everything out ourselves, what exactly should we plug into our moral GPS?

## Consequentialism

A third approach might be to pick a moral *direction*, rather than a specific destination or unguided exploration. This has the advantage pointing us towards higher ground, while still maintaining the flexibility to route around unforeseen obstacles. Moral philosophy gives us a few main options for this compass setting: Deontology, Virtue Ethics, and Consequentialism.

Of the three, Deontology (derived from the Greek *deon*, meaning obligation or duty) is most similar to the institutional approach above, suggesting that when confronted by an ethical dilemma, it's best to follow a prescribed series of rules. A well known example of Deontological philosophy comes from Immanuel Kant, who proposed the [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative), a meta-rule which suggests the following:

> Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.

While this sounds appealing at first glance, the categorical imperative infamously produces some counterintuitive results. When confronted with Nazi soldiers at his door, a Kantian might feel morally obligated to tell the truth about the Jewish family hiding in the attic, if honesty is the maximum that he wills to become a universal law. If rules like this are made to be broken, then a good Deontological framework must provide another (meta-meta-)rule, describing the circumstances when it's appropriate to violate the categorical imperative, and treating moral philosophy like an endless sequence of nested `if/else` statements is, at best, not an elegant solution to our navigation problem.

The next contender is Virtue Ethics, which attempts to


Virtues might be easier to recognize than consequences, but also more flexible than rules. Still, if consequences are what we care about, let's steer in that direction and see where it leads.

Deontological consequentalism - the maxim is consequentalism, which is the only universal law.

Three major players on the scene: deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism.

The problem with consequentalism might be that it asks us to plug in our destination without knowing it in advance. It might be correct, but not *useful*. This might *sound like* naive decentralization, but it does offer one critical insight, which is that we should be driven by the (estimated) consequences of our actions. This might often involve rule-following or virtuous behavior, but critically, consequentialism gives us the criteria from which to divert from both other approaches: when the overall consequences of our actions would be better if we did.

So how does this all relate to taking yourself hostage? From a consequentialist perspective, it is more than blamelessly wrong to settle for a sub-optimal set of preferences and motivations. We should be cautious about new civil liberties (because of Pareto efficiency, Chesterton's fence), but also cautious because we don't understand gender. Unlikely that someone would put themselves through this kind of discrimination, etc.

Taking yourself hostage is the claim that "I personally will suffer for my arbitrary beliefs" when there's a high confidence that these beliefs *are* arbitrary, because people with similar dispositions have different ones, there's no deterministic factor in having those beliefs, and it's conceivable that they could be altered with less than or equal to the effort being spend persecuting others in their defense.
