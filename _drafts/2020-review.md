title: The Best of the Worst
excerpt: 2020, year in review.
---

When I started using Roam back in August, it was with hope that blog posts would magically write themselves, springing forth of their own accord from the back-linked ether. Alas, I think the opposite has instead come to pass. Because Roam (which is a pleasure, by the way) so closely mimics the _feel_ of public expression, I notice that as soon as I record an idea in bulleted form I no longer feel the urge to share it.

This is only one of many excuses I could conjure for the deafening silence in this space for the past 10 months or so. For instance, there was the time when the world nearly ended due to COVID. And the time when the world nearly ended due to police killings. And the time when the world nearly ended due to the presidential election. Also, work has been busy, I guess.

Anyway, as 2020 mercifully winds down, I feel compelled to chronicle some of the thoughts I've had along the way, if only for their historical interest. And so I present 2020, a year in review.

## Consequential Technologies and Ordinary Evidence

Although I've been consulting full-time for a few years now, I finally got around to making it "official" with the state. And so I am now doing business as _Consequential Technologies_. I quite like this name, even though it's a bit of a mouthful, and my url ([consequential.tech](https://consequential.tech)) doubles as a spelling quiz. You can visit the aforementioned website (which only contains my CV at the moment), and maybe even hire me to build you something neat!

Ordinary Evidence is not quite so official, as far as organizations go, but is where I'm planning to post updates about my charitable giving, including a running total of my donations to-date. This is probably only of interest to me (and maybe to some nonprofits wondering where their money is coming from), but sharing publicly both serves as a kind of personal accountability mechanism, and has a nonzero chance of inspiring someone else to give by example.

## Failed Blog Posts

Looking back at my drafts folder, I find that I started writing at least seven(!) posts that never got published. I'll give each one a brief moment in the sun below.

### Future of American Politics (Parts 1 and 2)

This is where I tried my hand at becoming the next Nate Silver in the run-up to the 2020 election, and belatedly realized that I should stick to my strong suits. My goal was to start with a _very_ simple model of state congressional and presidential voting history, and to try to extrapolate future results from trends in the data:

From my (probably faulty) analysis, I learned that future battleground states may include Alaska, South Dakota, and West Virginia, that inequality of ideological representation will be reduced (as red states become more populous), and that building even simple political forecasting models takes a lot of work!

### COVID Politics and ProCon 2020

I became pretty worried about the stability of our institutions pretty early in the pandemic, though not for the correct reasons, as it turns out. My back-of-the-envelope analysis on March 9th showed that, projecting from what was known at the time, we could expect to lose several members of congress due to COVID. It also seemed likely that we would lsose
