**Edit 2022-09-22: Like me, this profile is a work in progress.**

OkCupid used to be pretty great, right? Back in 2012 or so? Instead of swiping you could _search_. The compatibility score _meant something_. You could just _send people messages_ (ok maybe that part wasn't so great for everybody).

Then _something(s) happened_ and online dating stopped working.

One of those "somethings" was that we got older. Older and somewhat jaded, in my case. And if not exactly less attractive, then at least more of an acquired taste.

Also there was the rise of the Tinder Clones (of which OKC is now one of the worst). Also Instagram filters and Snapchat lenses. Also, you know, a pandemic.

And so here we are a decade later writing bespoke "Date Me" docs, God help us. Somebody please, _please_ fix this.

In the meantime, let's get back to basics.

See [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19026772-dan-wahl) for more.

### Movies

Pseudo-intellectual sci-fi movies involving time loops (it's a Netflix genre).

I also have a special place for low-key romcoms like:

- Just Like Heaven
  - How Do You Know?
- Return To Me
- Under the Tuscan Sun
- Sleepless in Seattle
  - You've Got Mail
- The Holiday
- American Ultra(?)
- An American President
  - Dave
- The Little Hours
- Blast from the Past

### Shows

I watch _a lot_ of TV, but mostly in the background while working. I have probably seen _that show_ but only faintly remember details about the characters/plot.

### Music

- Beck
- Belle & Sebastian
- Bon Iver
- Fleet Foxes
- [Jacob Collier](https://youtu.be/eqY3FaZmh-Y) (holy shit right?)
- Kendrick Lamar
- My Bloody Valentine
- Radiohead
- Sharon Van Etten
- Sufjan Stevens
- Wilco

### Food

My diet mostly consists of:

- Blueberry bagels and Tofutti cream cheese
- MorningStar Chick'n patties
- Chai lattes (oat milk)
- Soylent (Mint Chocolate or Strawberry)

I _will_ eat all of your snacks though.

## The six things I could never do without

- Carbon
- Hydrogen
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Phosphorus
- Sulfur

## I spend a lot of time thinking about

How strange it is to be anything at all.

Also:

- Is my head moving faster than my feet?
- Really though, what the hell _is_ money?

## On a typical Friday night I am

[THIS PROMPT INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

## You should message me if

In the short-term, I'm open to connections of all varieties, but am especially looking for in-person dates with women 25 to 45 years old, who are smart, attractive, and kind (or at least 2/3).

In the medium-term, I'd like to find one or more new romantic partners that I see with some regularity. For reference, I currently have a long-distance partner of 5+ years.

In the long-term, I'm not sure! I've recently gone from being a "no thanks" to a "maybe?" on having kids (though it's still hard to imagine _intentionally_ seeking them out). I'm historically not much for cohabitation, and value my independence (and my partner's too).

### You shouldn't message me if

- You're exclusively looking for a monogamous partner
- You want to have kids _soon_
- You don't like truth-seeking conversational norms
- You're not willing to eat vegan around me (within reason)

But if you're on the fence, you might as well just say [hi](mailto:hi@danwahl.net)!
